# align-subtitles

This small Python script replaces the timestamps of one subtitle file with the timestamps of another.

The script was created in the context of the [atlascine project](https://github.com/geomedialab/atlascine), which publishes media featuring annotated subtitles in multiple languages. In this interface, for the annotations to appear consistently across multiple subtitle language version, timestamps have to be the same.
